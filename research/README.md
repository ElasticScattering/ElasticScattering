In this folder there is some python code to create graphs from the output data.

The two folders, high_residual and low_residual, contain the data used to create the figures in the paper. If you wish to do so, this data can be generated by running the program with the config file located in each folder.

Figure 1 a, b, c, d show intermediate information.
Figure 1 e1, e2 & Figure 2 a, b, c are high residual results
Figure 1 e3, e4 & Figure 2 d, e, f are low residual results
