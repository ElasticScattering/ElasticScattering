This code reproduces the graph of SM figure 2.
The data is pre-computed using ElasticScattering for 2 cases, one with many and one with few impurities.
The configuration files used to do so are provided in the data folders.
In this folder we show python code which uses that data to create the graphs shown in the paper.

Figure SM1 a, b, c, d show intermediate information.
Figure SM1 e1, e2 & Figure SM2 a, b, c are high residual results
Figure SM1 e3, e4 & Figure SM2 d, e, f are low residual results
